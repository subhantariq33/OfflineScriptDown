Every child of Extractor.kt must posses following pattern

1. Must have constructor as Internal Constructor.
2. Should have local format (which is instance of com.mugames.vidsnapkit.dataholders.Formats).
3. The overridden `analyse()` method must set the corresponding url & src.
4. Upon adding all the data to formats never forget to add them to mediaFormats(videoFormats) property of Extractor.kt.
5. The flow from child must be transferred to parent(Extractor) via calling the method finalize() which is available in Extractor class.

Sample
class NewExtractor internal constructor(url: String): Extractor(url){
    private val formats = Formats()
    override suspended fun analyse(){
        formats.src = "NewExtractor"
        formats.url = inputUrl

    }

}
