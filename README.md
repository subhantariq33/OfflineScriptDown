# VidSnapKit
VidSnapKit is a Kotlin Multi-Platform library that allows users to download videos from Instagram (Reels, Stories, Carousel Posts), Facebook, DailyMotion, LinkedIn, ShareChat, Vimeo and Likee. The library is built with support for Android and JVM, and can be easily included in other Java/Kotlin projects or Android apps.

## Installation⚙️
Add the following dependency to your app's build.gradle file:


    implementation 'com.github.subhantariq33:OfflineScriptDown:<release_version>'

You can see LATEST_VERSION from release of this current respository.

NOTE: You no need to add `v` and `beta` tag in implementaion line. Just add numerical version alone (eg: v2.0.1-beta as implementation `'com.github.subhantariq33:OfflineScriptDown:2.0.1'`)

Sync your project with Gradle.


## Usage⚒️
To download a video, call the downloadVideo function with the URL of the video and the platform it is from (Instagram, Facebook, DailyMotion, LinkedIn, ShareChat, or Vimeo) and cookies if applicable.


    val extractor = Extractor.findExtractor("https://www.instagram.com/p/B_5qXN6j5sd")
    extractor?.let {
                    cookies?.let { cookie ->
                        it.cookies = cookie
                    }
                    it.start { res ->
                        //Get data from here
                    }
                }
The function will return a Extractor object representing the extracted video.
